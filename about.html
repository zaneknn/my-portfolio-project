            My name is Zane, i'm originally from Latvia but now living in Norway and this is kinda my beginning
            in
            programming. Theres not much to say
            but until this moment, i enjoy every part of it. In 2021 i started my IT journey and enrolled
            in Microsoft Data engineering. After that i found interest in Back End (Phyton), but all roads
            leaded to Front End development. And then i met Matt Delac and his workshops SheCodes. I didn't
            wait
            a second when i enrolled in SheCodes Max. I knew i want to get all of it, so here I am, and this
            is my story. 👩🏼‍💻

            “This is for girls who have the tendency to stay up at night listening
            to music that reminds them of their current situation.
            <br />
            Who hide their fears, hurt, pain and tears under the smiles, laughs and
            giggles on a daily basis.
            <br />
            The girls who wear their heart on their sleeve.
            <br />
            The girls who pray that things will work out just once and they'll be
            satisfied.
            <br />
            The girls who sceam and cry to their pillows because everyone else fails
            to listen.
            <br />
            The girls who have so many secrets but wont tell a soul.
            <br />The girls that never win.
        </p>
        <p>
            The girls who have mistakes and regrets as a daily moral.
            <br />The girls that stay up all night thinking about that one boy and
            hoping that he'll notice her one day. <br />
            The girls who take life as it comes, to the girls who are hoping that
            it'll get better somewhere down the road.
            <br />
            For the girls who love with all their heart although it always gets
            broken. <br />
            To girls who think it's over.
            <br />
            To real girls, to all girls: You're beautiful.”
            <br />
            ― Zayn Malik
